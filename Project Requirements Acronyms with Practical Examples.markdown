## 2. The Acronyms with Practical Examples

### PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- **What It Is**: The product’s vision, outlining *what* it does and *who* it’s for.
- **Focus**: Features, user needs, goals.
- **Audience**: Product managers, designers, developers.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Feature**: Restaurant Search  
  > Users can search for restaurants by cuisine, location, or ratings. The search bar supports autocomplete and filters (e.g., “vegan,” “open now”).  
  > **User Need**: Quick discovery of nearby dining options.  
  > **Success Metric**: 80% of users complete a search within 30 seconds.

### SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
- **What It Is**: A technical guide for *how* the product is built.
- **Focus**: System requirements, architecture, APIs.
- **Audience**: Developers, QA engineers.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Functional Requirement**: Restaurant Search API  
  > The API accepts GET requests at `/api/restaurants` with parameters: `cuisine`, `location`, `rating`. It returns a JSON response with restaurant details.  
  > **Non-Functional**: Response time <500ms for 95% of queries.

### TDD (Technical Design Document)
- **What It Is**: A detailed plan for the system’s technical architecture.
- **Focus**: System design, database schemas, integrations.
- **Audience**: Developers, architects.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Component**: Order Processing System  
  > Uses a microservices architecture with a Node.js service for order creation.  
  > **Schema**: `orders` table with fields: `order_id`, `user_id`, `restaurant ``` restaurant_id ```, `items`, `total_price`, `status`.  
  > **Integration**: Kafka for real-time order updates.

### URD (User Requirements Document)
- **What It Is**: Captures end-user needs and UX expectations.
- **Focus**: User experience, usability.
- **Audience**: UX designers, product managers.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **User Need**: Easy Navigation  
  > Users want a clean interface with a bottom navigation bar for Home, Orders, and Profile.  
  > **UX Requirement**: High-contrast buttons for accessibility, with haptic feedback on taps.

### SOW (Statement of Work)
- **What It Is**: A contract defining project scope and deliverables.
- **Focus**: Work, timelines, costs.
- **Audience**: Clients, vendors.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Scope**: Develop a food delivery app with restaurant search, order placement, and payment integration by Q4 2025.  
  > **Deliverables**: iOS/Android apps, backend APIs, admin dashboard.  
  > **Cost**: $150,000, payable in milestones.

### RFP (Request for Proposal)
- **What It Is**: An invitation for vendors to bid on a project.
- **Focus**: Project overview, vendor criteria.
- **Audience**: Vendors, procurement teams.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Project**: Build a food delivery app with real-time tracking and payment processing.  
  > **Requirements**: Vendor must have 5+ years in mobile app development and experience with AWS.  
  > **Submission**: Proposals due by June 30, 2025.

### MRD (Market Requirements Document)
- **What It Is**: Defines market needs and competitive landscape.
- **Focus**: Market trends, customer demands.
- **Audience**: Product managers, marketing teams.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Market Need**: 60% of urban millennials prefer apps with <5-minute order processes.  
  > **Competition**: Uber Eats leads with fast delivery; we’ll differentiate with lower fees.

### LLD (Low-Level Design)
- **What It Is**: A granular technical design for system components.
- **Focus**: Detailed code-level implementation.
- **Audience**: Developers.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Module**: Payment Gateway  
  > Function `processPayment(amount, card_details)` validates card via Stripe API, logs transaction in `payments` table, and returns success/failure.  
  > **Error Handling**: Retry on timeout, notify user on failure.

### HLD (High-Level Design)
- **What It Is**: An overview of the system’s architecture.
- **Focus**: System components, data flow.
- **Audience**: Architects, developers.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Architecture**: Microservices with services for users, restaurants, orders, and payments.  
  > **Data Flow**: User app → API Gateway → Order Service → Database.  
  > **Diagram**: [Basic UML diagram of services].

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- **What It Is**: The simplest version of the product to test core features.
- **Focus**: Core functionality, quick launch.
- **Audience**: Product managers, early adopters.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **MVP Scope**: Basic app with restaurant search, menu browsing, and order placement for 5 restaurants in one city.  
  > **Excluded**: Real-time tracking, promotions (added in v2).

### RAD (Requirements Analysis Document)
- **What It Is**: Analyzes and prioritizes requirements before formal documentation.
- **Focus**: Stakeholder needs, feasibility.
- **Audience**: Analysts, product managers.
- **Example (Food Delivery App)**:
  > **Requirement**: Real-time order tracking.  
  > **Analysis**: High user demand, feasible with GPS APIs, prioritized for v2 due to cost.  
  > **Stakeholder Input**: 80% of beta testers want this feature.

## 3. The Big Picture: Project Documentation
These documents live under **Project Documentation**, the umbrella for all project-related artifacts. Other umbrella terms include:
- **Requirements Specification**: Combines BRD, PRD, SRS, etc.
- **Systems Engineering Documentation**: For complex systems with HLD, LLD, TDD.
- **Solution Design Document**: Blends vision and technical details.
- **Project Charter**: High-level scope with links to detailed docs.

In **Agile** projects, you might use **User Stories** or a **Product Backlog** instead of heavy documents, but the concepts remain.

## 4. How They Work Together
Think of a food delivery app as a puzzle:
- **BRD**: “This app will grow our business in the food delivery market.”
- **MRD**: “Customers want faster delivery than competitors.”
- **PRD**: “The app needs search, ordering, and tracking.”
- **URD**: “Users want a simple checkout process.”
- **FRD**: “The app supports credit card payments.”
- **SRS**: “Payments use Stripe API with REST endpoints.”
- **HLD**: “The app uses microservices with an API Gateway.”
- **LLD**: “The payment module handles retries with exponential backoff.”
- **TDD**: “The database schema includes `orders` and `payments` tables.”
- **RAD**: “We prioritized search over tracking for the MVP.”
- **MVP**: “Launch with basic ordering for a small market.”
- **SOW**: “Build the MVP for $100,000 by Q3.”
- **RFP**: “We’re seeking vendors with mobile app expertise.”

Each piece fits into the **Project Documentation** puzzle, guiding the project from idea to launch.
